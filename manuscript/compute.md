# Compute

Compute is a major part of the IaaS layer offered by Azure. Currently IaaS on Azure is divided into compute, networking and storage and some additional services for these three areas. In compute we offer Virtual Machines as well as Container Instances, a new kind of compute offering explicitly designed to run containers. In this chapter we talk about the details of compute on Azure, explain how VMs and CIs on Azure work and show you the best resources to get started.
